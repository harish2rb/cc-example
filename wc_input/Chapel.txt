Christine Chapel is a fictional character 
in the original Star Trek series, 
and in two of the Star Trek feature films. She was played by Majel Barrett.

The character was written for 
Barrett by Gene Roddenberry, after a previous character that he had 
written for her, Number One, had been dropped. Christine 
Chapel made her debut 
in the first season episode "The Naked Time". She was established as a regular character 
shortly afterward in the episode 
"What Are Little Girls Made Of?".
